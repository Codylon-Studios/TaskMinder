Navigate to `backend/src/prisma/migrations/`, open the relevant `.sql` file, and adjust the following:

* **INSERT and UPDATE statements** to recreate the previous single class setup
* **Account settings** to assign an admin and set the permission of others to 0

üìù *Detailed instructions are included as comments within the `.sql` file.*


### Step 3: Remove Unused Docker Secrets

Delete the following files from your Docker secrets folder:

* `classcode.txt`
* `dsb_user.txt`
* `dsb_password.txt`

```bash
docker compose up --build
```
