# Server Setup in Production v1.2.1 - stable
## What you'll need

* A valid domain (e.g. `taskminder.de`)
* A server running Ubuntu (â‰¥ 24.04 LTS) with sudo or root access
* The codebase of TaskMinder from [https://github.com/Codylon-Studios/TaskMinder](https://github.com/Codylon-Studios/TaskMinder)

---

## 1. DNS Configuration

Before proceeding with the server setup, configure your domain to point to your Ubuntu server.

### Get Your Server's Public IP Address

On your server, run:

```bash
curl ifconfig.me
```

Copy the returned IP (e.g., `203.0.113.42`). Make sure the server is not behind a router. The following guide will use this example IP â€” **replace it with your actual IP**.

---

### Configure DNS Records

Go to your domain registrarâ€™s DNS management page (e.g., Namecheap, GoDaddy, Cloudflare etc.) and add the following records:

| **Type** | **Name** | **Value**      | **TTL**          |
| -------- | -------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| A        | @        | `203.0.113.42` | Automatic / 3600 |
| A        | www      | `203.0.113.42` | Automatic / 3600 |

> This assumes you're using `example.com` and want `www.example.com` to also work.

We also use a subdomain for monitoring (`monitoring.example.com`) and a subdomain for a status page.

We use [https://betterstack.com/](https://betterstack.com/) as it offers custom subdomains for the status page, but you may choose another provider. After setting up the status page, follow BetterStackâ€™s instructions to configure the CNAME record.

For the monitoring page (`monitoring.example.com`), add the following record:

| **Type** | **Name**   | **Value**      |
| -------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| A        | monitoring | `203.0.113.42` |

---

### Wait for Propagation

DNS propagation can take a few minutes to several hours. Use tools like:

* [https://dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org)

Once your domain resolves to your serverâ€™s IP, proceed to the next step.

---

## 2. Install Required Packages

### Update and install dependencies:

This installs (if not already installed) Git, curl, NGINX, UFW, and Fail2Ban:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y git curl nginx ufw fail2ban
```

### Install Docker and Docker Compose:

Follow the official Docker documentation to install Docker and Docker Compose:

ðŸ”— [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

### Enable and start Docker

```bash
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
```

---

### Enable and configure firewall (UFW)

```bash
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
sudo ufw enable
```

### Secure SSH access

Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

```bash
PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no
```

Then restart SSH:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

### Configure Fail2Ban

```bash
sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
sudo systemctl start fail2ban
```

Check status:

```bash
sudo fail2ban-client status
```

---

## 3. Clone the Project from GitHub

```bash
cd /opt
sudo git clone https://github.com/Codylon-Studios/TaskMinder.git
cd TaskMinder
```
---

Hereâ€™s a revised version of your section with improved language and logical flow:

---

## 4. Configure NGINX

First, modify the `nginx.config` file to replace `taskminder.de` with your actual domain name.

```bash
vi nginx.config
```

or

```bash
nano nginx.config
```

Next, remove all `server` blocks that use `listen 443`â€”this is necessary to let Certbot handle SSL configuration properly. Keep only the `listen 80` block for now.

### Install Certbot and Obtain SSL Certificates

Install Certbot and its NGINX plugin:

```bash
sudo apt install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

Run Certbot to obtain SSL certificates (replace `example.com` and subdomains with your actual domains):

```bash
sudo certbot -d example.com -d www.example.com -d monitoring.example.com
```

Certbot will automatically update the configuration file at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/taskminder`. **Delete this file**, as youâ€™ll be using your custom config instead.

Now that you know the location and filenames of the generated certificates, update your original `nginx.config` at `/opt/TaskMinder/nginx.config`. Replace the certificate paths with the correct ones provided by Certbot.

### Deploy Your Final NGINX Configuration

```bash
# Copy your updated configuration
sudo cp /opt/TaskMinder/nginx.config /etc/nginx/sites-available/taskminder

# Enable and test the configuration
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/taskminder /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t

# Restart NGINX to apply changes
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

## 5. Set Up Non-Root User

Running as root means a compromised container could gain full system access. It is highly recommended to run the server as a non-root user (least privilege). Weâ€™ll use the name `ubuntu` for this guide, but you may choose another name.

```bash
sudo adduser ubuntu
sudo usermod -aG sudo ubuntu
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
```

If `adduser` fails, the user likely already exists (common on cloud providers like AWS or DigitalOcean). In that case, just add them to the `docker` group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
```

Give the user access to the project folder:

```bash
sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /opt/TaskMinder
```

Log out and reconnect as the `ubuntu` user:

```bash
exit
ssh ubuntu@<your-ip-address>
```

---


## 6. Automated Backup Setup (via Cron)

### Make the Backup Script Executable

The `cron` service needs permission to run the script. You only need to do this once.

```bash
chmod +x /opt/TaskMinder/db_backup.sh
```

### Add the Job to Crontab

This will schedule the script to run automatically.

Open the crontab editor for the current user:
```bash
   crontab -e
```

Add the following line to the bottom of the file, then save and exit:
```bash
   0 * * * * /opt/TaskMinder/db_backup.sh >> /var/log/backup.log 2>&1
```

### Verify the Setup

Confirm the job was added successfully by listing the active cron jobs:
```bash
   crontab -l
```
You should see the line you just added.

---

## 7. Add Docker Secrets

Navigate back to the TaskMinder folder and create directories for secrets and backups:

```bash
cd /opt/TaskMinder
mkdir docker_secrets
mkdir db-backups
```

Before starting the application, create the following **text files inside the `docker_secrets/` folder**. These files are used as Docker secrets for configuration:

| **Filename**         | **Description**                                                                          |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `classcode.txt`      | Custom class code required to access content.                                            |
| `db_name.txt`        | Name of the PostgreSQL database.                                                         |
| `db_password.txt`    | Password for the PostgreSQL database user.                                               |

| `db_user.txt`        | PostgreSQL database username.                                                            |
| `dsb_activated.txt`  | Whether DSB is enabled (`true` or `false`). If `false`, the next two files can be dummy values. |
| `dsb_password.txt`   | DSB login password.                                                                      |
| `dsb_user.txt`       | DSB login username.                                                                      |
| `redis_port.txt`     | Redis port (default is `6379`).                                                          |
| `session_secret.txt` | Secure session secret (e.g., `ez829ebqhjui2638sbajk`).                                   |
| `unsafe_deactivate_csp.txt` | Deactivates all csp headers when set to `true`, in production, set to `false`.    |
| `database_url.txt` | Provides the database URL for Prisma ORM:  `postgresql://db_user:db_password@taskminder-postgres:5432/db_name`. |

## 8. Setup `personalData.html`

1. **Navigate to the directory** where the example file is located:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/project/frontend/src/snippets/personalData/
   ```

2. **Copy the example file to create the production file:**

   ```bash
   sudo cp personalData.html.example personalData.html
   ```

3. **Edit the new file with `vi` to update the personal data:**

   ```bash
   sudo vi personalData.html
   ```
   
---

## 9. Run Docker Compose

Navigate to the project root and build/start the containers:

```bash
cd /opt/TaskMinder
docker compose up -d --build
```

---

## 10. TaskMinder Deployment Complete

Your TaskMinder server should now be running at:

* **[https://example.com](https://example.com)**
* **[https://www.example.com](https://www.example.com)**
* **[https://monitoring.example.com](https://monitoring.example.com)**

---

## 11. What's Next?

* Create an account to add your subjects, teams, and timetable.
* Visit [https://monitoring.example.com](https://monitoring.example.com) to change the default password **"admin"** to a secure one. Youâ€™ll be prompted to do this upon your first login.

---

## 12. Subsequent Updates
run:
```bash
cd /opt/Taskminder
./deploy.sh
```
to automatically pull the changes from the github repository, build and restart Docker containers.

## Database Restoration Procedure

Use this procedure to restore the database to a specific point in time from an existing backup file.

> **CAUTION:** Restoring the database is a destructive operation. It will **overwrite all current data** in the database with the data from the backup file. Proceed with caution and ensure you are restoring the correct file.

### List Available Backups

Identify the backup file you wish to restore from. The files are located in `/opt/TaskMinder/db-backups/`.

To see the most recent backups first, run:
```bash
ls -lt /opt/TaskMinder/db-backups/
```

### Run the Restore Script

Execute the `db_restore.sh` script with `sudo` and provide the backup file you chose.

```bash
sudo /opt/TaskMinder/db_restore.sh <backup-filename>
```

**Example:**
If you want to restore a file named `backup-2023-10-27_15-00-00.sql.gz`, you would run:
```bash
sudo /opt/TaskMinder/db_restore.sh backup-2023-10-27_15-00-00.sql.gz
```

### Verify the Restoration

After the script completes, connect to the application or database and verify that the data has been restored to the expected state.
