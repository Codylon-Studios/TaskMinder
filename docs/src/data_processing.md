# Data Processing

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of data processing practices for our educational management system. As part of our commitment to data protection and privacy compliance (GDPR/DSGVO), we document what personal and operational data is intentionally collected, stored, and processed, as well as identify potential unintentional data capture points across all system tables.

### Scope

This documentation describes all database tables defined in the current Prisma schema, with particular attention to the processing of personal data and related privacy implications. It also details the data stored in the Redis-powered cache, as well as the information collected during server monitoring (logs).

## Data Processing Analysis by Table

### 1. Account Table

**Purpose**: User authentication and access management.

| Field     | Data Type | Intentionally Stored                | Potentially Unintentional                            |
| :-------- | :-------- | :---------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| accountId | Integer   | Unique user identifier              | Could enable cross-system tracking                   |
| username  | String    | **Personal identifier** for login   | May reveal real names or personal info               |
| password  | String    | Encrypted authentication credential | Hash algorithms may become vulnerable                |
| createdAt | BigInt    | Account creation timestamp          | -                                                    |
| deletedAt | BigInt    | Account deletion timestamp          | -                                                    |

**Privacy Concerns**:

- Usernames might contain real names or other identifying information.
- Password security is critically dependent on the strength and implementation of the hashing algorithm.
- Personal data (`username`, `password`) is retained after the user has initiated deletion, creating a risk if the cleanup process fails.

**Solutions**:

- Hashing using bcrypt: bcrypt automatically generates a unique random salt per password, making rainbow table attacks ineffective. We use a sufficient number of salt rounds (`SALT_ROUNDS = 10`).
- Implemented a robust, automated cron job to ensure permanent deletion after the 30-day period.

### 2. Class Table

**Purpose**: Defines a class, acting as a central hub for all related data like students, subjects, events, homework and upload data.

| Field                  | Data Type | Intentionally Stored                           | Potentially Unintentional                                    |
| :--------------------- | :-------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| classId                | Integer   | Unique class identifier                        | -                                                            |
| className              | String    | The name of the class                          | May identify a specific group of students                    |
| classCode              | String    | Unique encrypted code for students to join the class     | Could lead to abusive joins if class code is breached        |
| classCodeHash          | String    | Unique hashed code for students to join the class (fast lookup)    | Could lead to abusive joins if class code is breached        |
| createdAt              | BigInt    | Timestamp of class creation                    | -                                                            |
| isTestClass            | Boolean   | Flag to identify test/demo classes             | -                                                            |
| defaultPermissionLevel | Integer   | Default user permission level for new members  | -                                                            |
| storageUsedBytes       | BigInt    | Current storage usage by the class             | May reveal class activity level and content volume           |
| storageQuotaBytes      | BigInt    | Storage limit allocated to the class           | -                                                            |
| dsbMobileActivated     | Boolean   | Flag if DSBMobile is active                    | -                                                            |
| dsbMobileUser          | String    | **Third-party service username (DSB Mobile)**  | **Risk**: Credentials for external system                    |
| dsbMobilePassword      | String    | **Third-party service password (DSB Mobile)**  | **Risk**: Enables account compromise                         |
| dsbMobileClass         | String    | Class Name to filter in substitution data      | May identify the specific class                              |


**Privacy Concerns**:
- `Class` centralizes all student data, making profile-building easier.

**Solutions**:
- Implemented change class code function/button for class members.
- Implemented strict access controls for rows containing third-party credentials.
- Implemented secure (aes-256-gcm) server-side encryption for class codes, 3rd-party (DSB Mobile) migration coming soon

**Privacy Concerns**:

- Free-text fields (`name`, `description`) are high-risk for unintentional storage of personal data.
- The combination of event data, when linked to a `Class`, can reveal detailed schedules and activities for a specific group of students.
- For private events, `accountId` links the event and its contents to the owning account and restricts visibility to that user.

**Solutions**:

- Provided clear guidance or input masks to discourage users from entering personal data in event names and descriptions.
- Regularly audit event data for inappropriate content.

**Privacy Concerns**:

- **Content Profiling**: The combination of `uploadName`, `uploadDescription`, `uploadType`, `mimeType`, and `size` can create detailed profiles of what type of content users and teams are sharing.
- **User Attribution**: The `accountId` field directly links uploaded content to specific users, creating a permanent record of who shared what.
- **Team Dynamics**: Upload patterns (frequency, size, type) can reveal team collaboration dynamics and potentially identify active vs. inactive members.
- **Temporal Tracking**: Timestamps enable detailed analysis of when users are active and how they collaborate over time.

**Solutions**:

- Implement strict file type validation and size limits to prevent abuse.
- Ensure `errorReason` messages are sanitized and do not expose sensitive details.
- Implement retention policies for old uploads and automatic cleanup.
- Monitor storage usage patterns to detect potential abuse.

## Cross-Table Privacy Risks

The `Class` schema as a central entity increases cross-table risks.

### 1. Granular Profile Building

Combining data across tables enables the creation of highly detailed user profiles:

- Student Profile: Academic performance (`HomeworkCheck`) + social connections (`JoinedTeams`) + daily schedule and location (`Lesson`) + specific activities (`Event`). All this data can be correlated through a combination of `accountId` and `classId`.

### 2. Behavioral and Social Analytics

- The normalized structure allows for analytics on student behavior, such as correlating homework completion (`HomeworkCheck`) with team membership (`JoinedTeams`) or specific lessons (`Lesson`).
- Social network graphs can be generated from the `JoinedTeams` and `Account` tables, revealing peer influence and group dynamics.

## Data Collected and Stored in Redis and Telemetry Systems (Prometheus/Loki)

### Redis

Our Redis architecture serves as a cache to temporarily store data, reducing database load and improving performance. Cached data is automatically cleared when the corresponding data is deleted from the database. The following types of content are stored:

* Homework, events, lessons, timetables, teams, substitutions and upload metadata for each class
* Authenticated user and class information
* User sessions (from express-session)

---

### Telemetry Data

To maintain and improve our service quality, we collect certain telemetry data, which is stored in server logs:

* Date and time of the request
* Endpoint path and HTTP method
* HTTP status code
* Size of the returned data
* Referrer information
* User agent details (e.g., browser name and version, operating system, etc.)

**Retention:** Logs are stored for **14 days (±2h)** and are permanently deleted thereafter.
