2) Login as the user `demo` with the password `demo` - you are automatically part of the demo class

You cannot edit the shown data yourself but you can get a short overview of what TaskMinder is capable.

Just log out (settings > account) and leave the class (settings > student) and you are ready to continue!

### Test classes
**Interested, but not totally sure?** You can simply create a test class which gets deleted after 24 hours so you have enough time to test out all the features!

Just create a new account and create a new class. Tick the option "Create as test class". You are now free to test out all the features of TaskMinder - you can even join with other devices / accounts and see how TaskMinder syncs everything!

### Regular classes
**TaskMinder sounds appealing to you? *Perfect!*** You can turn your test class into a regular class or if you haven't created a test class just create a regular one!

Now you are ready to use TaskMinder - **Have fun!**
